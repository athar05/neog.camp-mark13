This is an app built using vanilla.js, HTML and CSS, which checks if a given birthdate is a plindrome or not. 

It takes the birthdate of the user as an input and checks if it is a palindrome for the followind date formats: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY etc. The app displays if the 
users birthdate is a plaindrome for any of the above date formats, if not then it also shows by how many days the user missed the next palindrome date.
